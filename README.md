  3)Project_code folder contains main.py our main code which uses module util placed in utility/util.py and O/P and I/P files paths are placed in config.json.
  4)also main_notebook is placed in Project_code folder to execute in notebooks.
  5)Clone CaseStudy-DataEngineer Repos and execute main.py to acheive the expected output.
